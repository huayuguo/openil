Package: iucode-tool
Description-md5: 85b8e9a4d04e1dafc3c5baa7e46a23a4
Description-en: Intel processor microcode tool
 iucode_tool is a program to manipulate IntelÂ® X86 and X86-64 processor
 microcode collections, and to use the kernel facilities to upgrade the
 microcode on Intel system processors.
 .
 It can load microcode data files in text and binary format, sort, list and
 filter the microcodes contained in these files, write selected microcodes to a
 new file in binary format, or upload them to the kernel.
 .
 It operates on non-free microcode data downloaded directly from Intel or
 installed by the intel-microcode package.
