# Minimal SD card image for the NXP boards Template
#
# We mimic the .sdcard NXP's image format:
# * the SD card must have 4 kB free space at the beginning,
# * U-Boot is dumped as is,
# * a FAT partition at offset 8 MB is containing zImage/uImage and DTB files
# * a single root filesystem partition is required (ext2, ext3 or ext4)
